# Overview

I've created a simple interactive storyteller that is designed to tell a short story to the user and give them
a chance to interact with the story as they go.  I have been working to better understand the interactions of javascript and html when displayed together.

I used VS Code to write my program.

I wrote it purely to have fun (besides meeting class assignment requirements obviously), but it's purpose it merely to entertain.

# Development Environment

I used VS code to write my program, which can be opened in a browser.

I used Javascript and HTML, and didn't need too much help since I have experience with both, but I did google a couple syntax related questions as neeeded.

# Future Work

- Item 1: I could work to make the adventure mroe detailed, more exciting, etc.  I didn't worry about it too much this time around just because I was worried more about code functionality than anything else.
- Item 2- There are a couple things I could tweak just to make it more presentable, add some css to pretty it up, etc.
- Item 3_ I could also work on streamlining the game, possibly remove the original two buttons as the game goes on so you have to restart it in order to go back, add a go back button, add a restart button, etc.
